This repository supports a University of Washington project to develop a low-cost imaging tool that measures pH changes induced by coatings that host dye indicators.  The first milestone of this project is to use pH indicator strips as reliable quantitative sensors, achieving specs established by UNICEF. Ultimately, we plan to use these tools to screen for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in babies.
